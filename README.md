# Tic-Tac-Toe
A classic Tic Tac Toe game for two players.

## Run
You will first have to download the files. The game can be played from either the terminal or a JavaFX GUI. 

### Terminal Game
To play in the terminal, compile the TerminalBoard.java and PlayTerminal.java files in the terminal_game package and run the PlayTerminal class.

### JavaFX GUI Game
To play in the GUI, open the project in Eclipse and run the JavaFXApp.java file in the game package as a java application. Click positions on the grid to place marks.

## Improvements
I want to improve the JavaFX GUI by refactoring some of the Group nodes and improving the integration with the Board class. Additionally, I would like to have the app place a line over the winning play, as in regular pen-and-paper tic tac toe.
